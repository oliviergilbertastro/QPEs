To solve the make_source_mask() problem:
1. Copy the "problem_solvers/photutils_init_template.py" content into the package at photutils/__init__.py
2. Copy the "problem_solvers/photutils_core_template.py" content into the package at photutils/detection/core.py
3. If any problems of the type "function blabla received an unexpected argument 'kernel'" happen, just delete the 'kernel' parameter from the function.
4. If anything persists, good luck!
